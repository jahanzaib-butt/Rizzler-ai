Benefits – How will this enhance the project or user experience?
Possible implementation – If you have any ideas for how this could be implemented, share them!
Submitting Code
We appreciate code contributions! When you're ready to submit a pull request (PR), please ensure the following:

Branch naming – Use descriptive names for your branches, e.g., fix-issue-42 or feature-new-ai-model.
Small, focused PRs – Keep your PRs small and focused. If the PR includes multiple changes, consider splitting them into multiple smaller PRs.
Code style – Follow the coding style guidelines used in the project.
Documentation – If your changes impact the functionality or usage of Rizzler AI, please update the documentation accordingly.
Testing
Before submitting your PR, ensure that your code passes all existing tests and that you've written tests for any new features or bug fixes.

Run existing tests – Ensure the project tests still pass after your changes:
copy
# Example, adjust based on your testing framework
pytest tests/
Write new tests – If your changes introduce new functionality, write unit tests to cover your changes.
Test in different environments – If possible, test your code in different environments to ensure compatibility.
